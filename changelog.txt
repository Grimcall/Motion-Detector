##Version 1.3

-Notes:
-Version 1.2.2 is the same file without .csv conversions or time recording. Essentially just a motion tracker.

-Additions:
*Updated requirements.txt
*Added event_recorder.py with Bokeh graphing. Outputs an .html file with recorded events and the specific times.
*Added motion events. Exports a .csv file with detected motion events and the times at which they were detected.

-Tweaks:
*Reduced framerate + detection sensitivity (adjustable through time.sleep)
*Increased contour drawing size (adjutable through obj_size variable)

-To add:
*Details in resulting .html from event_recorder.py
*Speed Monitor
